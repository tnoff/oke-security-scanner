# Development

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [Trivy](https://trivy.dev/latest/getting-started/installation/) installed and on `$PATH`
- OCI config (`~/.oci/config`) with credentials for the tenancy you're targeting
- A kubeconfig with access to the OKE cluster you want to scan

## Setup

Scan, cleanup and secret-age-tracker are separate installable packages (see
`AGENTS.md`'s File Structure). To work on the scanner:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]" -e packages/core[telemetry] -e packages/scan
```

To also work on cleanup or secret-age-tracker:

```bash
pip install -e packages/ocir_cleanup -e packages/secret_age
```

## Running tests

Run the full suite (pytest, pylint, bandit):

```bash
tox
```

Or run individual steps:

```bash
tox -e pytest    # tests only
tox -e pylint    # linting only
tox -e bandit    # security scan only
```

## Configuration

Each package has its own env vars and `Config` dataclass (no shared `Config`);
all are optional with defaults. The full per-package reference is in
[README.md](README.md#environment-variables). `OCIR_CLEANUP_ENABLED` defaults to
`false` (dry run), so a local `python -m ocir_cleanup` only reports.

## Running locally

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
# set any other variables you need ...

python -m scan             # scanner
python -m ocir_cleanup     # OCIR cleanup (pip install -e packages/ocir_cleanup first)
python -m secret_age       # secret-age tracker (pip install -e packages/secret_age first)
```
